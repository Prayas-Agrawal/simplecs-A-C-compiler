# simplecs-A-C-compiler
Current: Can perform optimised compilation of simple C codes  for the x86 ISA\
Preprocessor not implemented yet \

## optimisations currently supported:
> Common subexpression Elimination
> Constant propogation
> Constant Folding
> Strength Reduction
> Dead code elimination

## TODO:
>Register allocation optimisation
>Represent IR as LLVM bitcode instead
>Transfer function optimisation
>Reference counting of debug string objects. Currently uses too much memory

# Simplecs, A simple C compiler
## Planned some interesting stuff
